                <li>In this course, you learned how to create a Docker server and an NGINX hosting system with Apache server. What was the impact of this course on your future career goals?</li>
                <li>What was difficult or surprising to you about NGINX, Apache and Docker, and why?</li>
                <li>Did this course inspire you to want to continue using Docker? Why or why not?</li>

                    <li>This course provided me with an insight to managing and deploying container based images for deployment in any environment. As a developer, the ability to easily package and deliver applications and be up and running quickly for a development environment plays a major role in my career. Knowledge of web servers like Apache and NGINX are important since both are very popular open source web servers used in development.</li>
                    <li>Surprising to me about Apache was the overall simplicity of installing and running the server. NGINX was pretty straight forward however, Docker seemed quite a bit complex at first because of so many configuration options.</li>
                    <li>This couse did actually inspire me to continue using Docker. I'd like to work more with Docker and actually use the environments in a real world scenario for development. I think Docker is actually a very powerful useful tool and platform for building portable containers to package up for multiple types of environments.
